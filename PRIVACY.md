## Storage of Data

Data is stored in a MongoDB database. The database is secured to prevent external access, however no guarantee is provided and the Bot owners assume no liability for the unintentional or malicious breach of Data. In the event of an unauthorised Data access, users will be notified through the Discord client application.

## User Rights

You have the right to request the removal of relevant Data. You also have the right to "opt out" of Data collection - please note that this will disable specific features of the bot such as the `level` feature for your account.
