# My Discord Bot

Welcome to the repository for my discord bot, seen as `nhbot` in my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/PHqDbkg).

This bot was built using Discord.js, and is currently only hosted locally. As development progresses, I intend to find a live server to host the bot on.

## Feature Requests

Do you have a feature you would like to see added to this bot? Create a [new issue](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/discord-bot/issues/new/choose) using the "Feature Request" template and we will get started on it as soon as we are able.

## Found a Bug

Did you discover a bug when interacting with this bot? Unfortunately, despite our best efforts we are still not quite perfect. You can submit a [new issue](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/discord-bot/issues/new/choose) using the "Bug Report" template and we will address it as soon as possible.

## Join Our Team!

Are you interested in contributing to the development of this bot? We welcome all who want to assist! If you would like to contribute, you are welcome to fork the repository and make your changes. Submit a pull request when you are ready for us to review your changes.

### Bot Test Server

You are welcome to join the [Bot Test Server](https://discord.gg/BqRZ85t) to work with other developers and test your changes to the bot. Remember that you'll need to send us an invite link for your bot to join, and you'll need to have the bot running (this can be done locally while you're working on the files).

### Configure Your Bot

The code is written to look for a `.env` file. This file will contain the discord bot token to link the code to the bot. For security reasons, the `.env` file for this bot is not available in this repository. To set up your own bot, you will need to create a `.env` file in the _root_ directory of your bot repository, and add `DISCORD_TOKEN: "your token here"`.

Additionally, you will need to run the `npm run build` script before you can run the `npm run start` script.

### Need Some Help?

Do you need more information on how to contribute? Submit a [new issue](https://github.com/nhcarrigan/discord-bot/issues/new/choose) using the "Contributor Request" template and describe the level of instruction you need, and we will help you get started.
